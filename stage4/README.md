Stage 4: Reverse Engineering Project Compass
============================================

This is the fifth part of the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree at Udacity.

The goal behind this project is to act as a quiz for understanding and ultimately deciding which of four different paths to pursue further as part of the IPND program for the final project.

* Front End
* Back End
* Mobile (Android or iOS)
* Data Analyst

`answers.html` contains questions on which of these four developer types would be involved in performing certain tasks for an app called Project Compass.

These files were mostly written by Udacity. My work is only the answers to the given questions.
