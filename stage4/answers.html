    <!--Student Answer Section-->
    <!-- Directions for completing -->
    <p>Directions: Identify which type of programmer(Front End, Back end, Mobile Programmer or Data Analyst) would work on the features of Project Compass. Type your answers between the paragraph tags and be sure to provide an brief explanation for your choice.</p>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <p>1. Which programmer would build and manage the database for storing map pin locations in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 1 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back End</p>
      <p>Working with databases is one of the areas that back end developers specialize in.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <p>2. Which programmer would make Project Compass responsive on different screen sizes on the web?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 2 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End</p>
      <p>This involves the appearance of a webpage and how the page works across multiple devices and screen sizes.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <p>3. Which type of mobile programmer (Android or iOS) would be using Swift to turn Project Compass into a mobile app?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 3 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>iOS</p>
      <p>Objective C and Swift are the programming languages used for developing iOS applications. Android applications can use Java, C, and C++.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <p>4. Which programmer would add the image <img class="compass_icon"src="img/compass.svg"> to Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 4 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End</p>
      <p>This involves putting the image on the page visibly, which has to do with the appearance of the site.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <p>5. Who would evaluate information about Project Compass users to give insights for product decisions?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 5 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst</p>
      <p>The finding of relationships and patterns in data is what data analysts do.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6-->
    <p>6. Who would make requests to the Google Maps API in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 6 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front End</p>
      <p>This involves making requests to other internet sources for information, as opposed to actually building and providing said information. Front end developers work with APIs while back end developers actually build them.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <p>7. Which programmer would need to consider hardware components to make Project Compass usable with a microphone or camera?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 7 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Mobile</p>
      <p>Using the microphone and camera on a phone is rather common for mobile applications, especially since these devices come with them built in.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <p>8. Which programmer would make a post request endpoint to add comments onto Project compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 8 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back End</p>
      <p>Post requests happen behind the scenes. It is the interaction between client and server, and it affects the data stored on the server.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <p>9. Which programmer would look at user clicking rates on Project Compass to make recommendations for external tourism sites?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 9 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analyst</p>
      <p>Based on relationships and patterns seen, a recommendation is being made. That is a decision based on gathered data.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 10 -->
    <p>10. After evaluating these four different paths into programming, which role are you most interested in pursuing? Why?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 10 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back End<p>
      <p>Of these four paths, I have pretty much focused on front end up until now. I have a bit of an interest in mobile applications, especially with the emergence of devices like the OUYA, Amazon's Fire TV, and the Nvidia Shield that run Android. However, I think that since my interest there falls more into the game-making end, there are probably other things I should work on before hitting that.</p>
      <p>I was pretty interested in learning more about the back end of things when I originally signed up for this Nanodegree, before the new setup for deciding paths occurred. I think I would like to pursue that area further at this time. I have interacted with some back end things in the past, such as SQL, and I think it would be good to understand these things better.</p>
