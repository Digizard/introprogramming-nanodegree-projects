						<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
						<p class="subtitle">The Basics of the Web and HTML</p>
					</header>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>World Wide Web</h3>

						<p>
							With a computer, a user is connected to the internet and looks up a URL address in the browser. The browser makes an HTTP request. Servers reply to this request with files, which the browser interprets and displays to the user.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>What is HTML?</h3>

						<p>
							Most of the files on the internet are pages made up of HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. These pages hold the text content that you see, as well as markup. Markup is the special code language that controls what a page looks like. References are made to other documents, such as images and videos, which allow them to appear on a page. One of the main features of HTML that makes the internet what it is are hyperlinks, the links that allow you to go to other pages.

						<h3>Computers are Stupid</h3>

						<p>
							Computers follow instructions they are given exactly. Small errors that a human understands the intention of are usually misunderstood by a computer. They might be taught how to guess what to do, but as autocorrect on phones show, it's often not very good to rely on.

						<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
						<p class="subtitle">Creating a Structured Document</p>
					</header>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Why Start with HTML and CSS?</h3>

						<p>
							Web pages are visual from the start, giving you instant results you can see as you work and make changes. You can also show what you make to anyone easily.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Languages of the Web</h3>

						<p>
							HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the trio of languages that make up the front-end part of the web. Each one plays a different role. HTML provides the structure of each page, CSS provides the style, and JavaScript provides the interactive components.
						</p>

						<p>
							JavaScript is not to be confused with Java, which is a different language entirely. Their names may seem confusing, but think of it like "ham" and "hamburger" or "car" and "carpet". However, this similarity was not on accident as Netscape, the creators of JavaScript, was working with Sun Microsystems, the creators of Java. Netscape thought using a similar name to Sun's popular language would attract people, and that turned out to be true.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Developer Tools</h3>

						<p>
							Most browsers contain a set of tools known as Developer Tools. These can be used to look at the underlying structure and other components of a website. You can make adjustments to the page to test design ideas, all of which are temporary and gone when you refresh the page. This makes Dev Tools very handy for web developers.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Tree-Like Structure of Web Pages</h3>

						<p>
							A web page is made up of elements within elements. If you mapped this out, you would end up with a tree-like structure. It's much like a family tree considering that elements have a parent-child relationship, with child elements being within their parent.
						</p>

						<p>
							Using Dev Tools, we can see and interact with this tree. The elements are neatly collapsed within one another, and by opening them, we can make our way down from the basic structure of the page (like the body) to any element.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Document Object Model</h3>

						<p>
							The DOM is the method browsers use to turn written HTML into the tree-like structure we see within Dev Tools, which is known as the DOM tree or simply "the DOM" for short. It's essentially the current HTML-based state of the page, which can be manipulated by Dev Tools or JavaScript.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Boxes in HTML</h3>

						<p>
							Everything on a web page is made up of boxes, even the items that are circles or other shapes. div is a common container element for grouping related elements together. It's good to label div elements with classes that make clear what they're for.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Crossing the Skills Gap</h3>

						<p>
							Starting from a novice level, we're beginning to progress towards being experts. For novices, facts are scattered. Through reflection, we can begin to think like an expert and work toward the structured understanding that an expert has. Although a novice may have good ideas, only through practice will we be able to gain the ability to execute those ideas. While practicing, we begin to act and look like an expert.

						<h2>Lesson 3</h2>
						<p class="subtitle">Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</p>
					</header>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Understanding CSS</h3>

						<p>
							In the earlier days of web pages, any styling was done directly in the HTML pages. This made for a lot of tags, repeated code, and possibilities for mistakes.
						</p>

						<p>
							Cascading Style Sheets allow web developers to separate style from the structure of the page, allowing for the avoidance of repetition and the benefits that brings. CSS allows style rules to be constructed that can be applied across multiple elements with minimal code, being really easy to apply in different places.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Cascading Power</h3>

						<p>
							The "cascading" part in CSS means that, given multiple rules, the most specific one applies. In this way, you can apply more universal rules, but then still have different rules apply in certain situations. It would be like if the house rules at home could override the state and country laws.
						</p>

						<p>
							Because of this, styles can be inherited. Child elements receive styling passed down from their parents and other ancestors, so long as the children do not override a property with their own.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Styling the Code Itself</h3>

						<p>
							Writing clean and clear code is a major thing to do if you want to have quality code. Proper indenting, logical structures, blank lines between sections of code, and comments make for well-written code. You should shoot for code that clearly explains itself, reserving comments more for <em>why</em> you went the route you did.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>

						<p>
							Not writing the same thing over and over is an important part of creating quality code. By using options that allow you to write once and apply anywhere, you save time and help avoid and deal with errors in your code.
						</p>

						<p>
							CSS allows us to avoid repetition in our web pages. Instead of writing the same styles on similar elements over and over, we can create one style rule and have it apply to all those elements. Less hunting down and changing is less time spent. If you do it the long way and make a mistake, either in how you wrote the style or how you copy and pasted it, that's more work to fix, too. Such copy and paste errors are more easily avoided with CSS, and there's a lot less to edit if you do make a mistake.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section class="concept">
						<h3>Learning Resources</h3>

						<p>
							There's many great resources coders can turn to for helping them out.
