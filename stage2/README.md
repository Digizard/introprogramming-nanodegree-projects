Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz
===========================

This program is the third part of the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree at Udacity.

Keeping with the RWBY theme established with the previous projects, this is a fill-in-the-blanks quiz based on the RWBY series. It is made with Python.


How to Play
-----------

Download the `rwby_quiz.py` file to your computer.

### Mac and Linux

Open a terminal window at the directory containing `rwby_quiz.py`. Write in:

```
python rwby_quiz.py
```

Then hit the enter key.

### Windows

Open up `rwby_quiz.py` in IDLE. In the menu, go to _Run_ and then _Run Module_.
